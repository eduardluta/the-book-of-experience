            <p>
                The Book of Experience is a collaborative archive of human moments—the experiences that changed us and the fears that shaped us. This is a space for reflection, connection, and shared wisdom.
            </p>

        <section class="purpose">
            <span class="section-label">Why This Exists</span>
            <p>
                We believe that our most profound teachers are often strangers who've walked similar paths. By sharing our transformative experiences and deepest fears, we create a living document of human wisdom—a book that writes itself, one story at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every story here is a gift from someone who chose vulnerability over silence. Every fear shared is a reminder that we're not alone in our struggles.
            </p>
